Flyway looks for db/migration folder by default.
Just adding the dependency will cause Flyway to migrate on startup(Also requires spring-boot-starter-jdbc and postgresql).

Creating database:

Log into database as user postgres(root user):

Create new Database user:
create user tester with password 'pass';
